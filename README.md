# Overview
ZeroProbe is an exploit development and enumeration framework designed for security researchers, exploit developers, penetration testers, and red teamers. It provides a set of powerful modules to analyze system vulnerabilities, detect privilege escalation paths, map kernel exploits, identify weak file permissions, and enumerate security misconfigurations. By leveraging direct syscall execution, memory analysis, and DLL hijacking detection, ExploitForge helps professionals assess security defenses and develop exploitation strategies while maintaining a low forensic footprint.

# Features

# 1- Kernel Exploit Detection with CVE Mapping

Detects unpatched Windows kernel vulnerabilities by mapping the system's kernel version to known CVEs. It retrieves a list of potential kernel exploits and alerts the user if vulnerabilities are found. The results help identify security risks that may be leveraged for privilege escalation or remote execution.
